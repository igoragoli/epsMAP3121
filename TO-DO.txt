To-Do List

1. Change f() to return the force f = r(t)ghk(x) given a point pk. - OK
2. Update LDLtDecomposition() to support sparce matrices. - OK
3. Update solveLinearSystem() to support sparce matrices. - OK
4. Code buildNormalSystem() - OK
5. Code readTestFile() to read teste.txt - Done, not tested
6. Modify tempGraphs to support plotting only the graph at t = T. Maybe an argument like 
   tempGraphs(onlyFinal=1), where onlyFinal indicates whether we must plot only the final graph or
   the intermediate ones. - OK
7. Code quadraticError(uT, solutions)
8. Code printResults() - OK
9. Fix the broadcast problem between solutions[k] and solutions[k][1:-1] - OK
10. Check if quadraticError is working correctly
11. Check if tempGraphs is working correctly
12. Discuss about the total execution time 
13. Check how the teachers want their graphs 

Now, the old LDLtDecomposition() used in Crank-Nicolson will be called 
"triDiagLDLtDecomposition". Also, solveLinearSystem will be renamed to 
"triDiagSolveLinearSystem".
